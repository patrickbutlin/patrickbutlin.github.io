				<p>I am a philosopher of mind and cognitive science and Senior Research Lead at <a href="https://eleosai.org">Eleos AI</a>. My current work is on mental capacities and attributes that could ground moral status in AI, such as consciousness and agency. I try to work out which capacities and attributes matter, what it would take for AI systems to have them, and how we can test for them.</p>
				<p>These topics are interesting because they involve exploring both the potential of AI and the mechanisms behind the experiences that matter to us. They are also important: it is plausible that some AI systems will be moral patients soon, so we need to prepare for this possibility. Although there are many hard questions in this area, I am optimistic about the potential of philosophical and interdisciplinary research to make valuable, practical progress.</p>
				<p>From 2021 to 2025 I was a researcher at the University of Oxford, first at the Future of Humanity Institute and then the Global Priorities Institute. I spent the first half of 2021 conducting research on AI alignment, thanks to a grant from Survival and Flourishing, and from 2017 to 2020 I was a Teaching Fellow at King's College London. Before that, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow of the Centre for Philosophical Psychology at the University of Antwerp from 2016 to 2017, and a Stipendiary Lecturer in Philosophy at Hertford College, Oxford from 2014 to 2017.</p>
				<p>In 2015 I completed my Ph.D. in Philosophy at King's College, London, where I was supervised by David Papineau and Nick Shea.</p>
